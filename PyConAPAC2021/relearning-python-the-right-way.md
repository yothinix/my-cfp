# Relearning Python the right way

## Talk Abstract
What do you think if I tell you that the way most of us learning programming language is in the wrong way. If the answer is no, My talk will change your mind.

## Talk Description
Learning the new programming language is hard and it can be harder when it is your first language you learn to program. When it comes to approach and look at the answer in the forum it often is one of watching the video tutorial, working on a pet project, or even taking a course. I believe that all of these methods are missing at least one point that you should know when learning a new language and in this talk, I will present to you a framework for picking up a new language that focusing on each piece of the language itself and help you to become a better programmer later on.

## Notes
I have train Python to so many people and take so many courses with years of experience in using Python in production software and I have seen many pitfalls people get when picking up a new language including myself. This is why I come up with this talk to help people get over this pitfall and be better programmers with a solid foundation in the language.
